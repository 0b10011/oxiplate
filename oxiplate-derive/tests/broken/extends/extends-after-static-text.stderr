  = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Static`
  = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args` which comes from the expansion of the macro `print` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

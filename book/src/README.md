# Oxiplate: Template engine for Rust

<div class="warning">

This project is experimental
and features described in this book may not yet be implemented,
or may be implemented in a different way.

</div>

Oxiplate is a template engine that uses a derive macro
to compile templates into Rust code for the best performance.
It focuses on straightforward [escaping](templates/writs/escaping.md)
and powerful [whitespace control](templates/whitespace-control.md).

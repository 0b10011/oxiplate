  = help: message: not implemented: Escaping requires the `oxiplate` library, but you appear to be using `oxiplate-derive` directly. Replacing `oxiplate-derive` with `oxiplate` in the dependencies should fix this issue, although you may need to turn off some default features if you want it to work the same way.

error[E0277]: `Data` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`

10 |     print!("{}", Data { var: "foo" });
   |             --   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `Data` cannot be formatted with the default formatter
   |             |
   |             required by this formatting parameter
   |
   = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Data`
   = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args` which comes from the expansion of the macro `print` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
